## About Me
Hello everyone! I am Ahmed Elsayed. I am an international student from Egypt. I am a rising junior at Whitman College. My majors are Computer Science and Mathematics in addition to a Creative Writing minor. I plan to graduate by May 2023. After graduation, I plan to conintue my studies at a graduate school program. I have not yet decided on a research area: I am still enjoying the pursuit of exploration. However, I know that I want to channel my education into accessibility and fairness in the tech world. In our current times, I believe that Technology immensly contributes to the issues of equity, accessibility, and equality.
