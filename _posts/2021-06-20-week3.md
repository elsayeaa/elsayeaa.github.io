# General Experience 
This week was a roller-coaster. I have had so many struggles installing packages, setting-up environments, downloading tools, fixing code, refacroring, writing/rewriting/deleting, etc. However, I was able to create a graphical causal model and run experiments on [http://www.causality.inf.ethz.ch/data/LUCAS.html](The LUCAS lung cancer toy dataset). I learned about [https://networkx.org/](networkx) library for dealing with graphs. I have also learned a lot about using args. I have reviewed by OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) skills, brushed up my numpy, matplotlib, and pandas knowledge. I have been also working on research blogs, which are more or less a litterature review. I still do believe I need tons of practice, but I feel like I am getting there. It's been a very exhuasting, laborous weeks, but it was enriching and interesting as well. I guess that's what this research about! 
# Readings (Litrature Review,  online blogposts, and tutorials)
I have read [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00524/full](Review of Causal Discovery Methods Based on Graphical Models). I have also reviewed independence and read some parts of [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10500.pdf](Causality for Machine Learning) to get to know more about causality.    
# Experiments & Algorithms 
## Experiement using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) 
I have re-created the graphical causal model of the LUCAS database as shown below: 
For my experiment this week I have followed these steps: 
1. I have created a scm (structural causal model) using the LUCAS lung cancer toy dataset, as shown below:

Then, I generated dataframes using the scm as shown below as well:

2. Then, I have chosen a target outcome: it was Lung_Cancer for this dataset. 
3. I have applied multiple causal discovery algorithm (e.g. PC, GES, etc.) -- you can learn more about these algorithms from the readings I have posted. 
4. After that, I extracted parents and children from the causal graph. Then, I generated dataframes for the outcome, parents, and children. These will be later used for the ERM, causal ERM, and anticausal ERM learning frameworks. The dataframes look exactly like the general dataframe but with only parents+outcome, children+outcome, or parents+children+outcome columns.
5. Then, I created a target dataset with different target domains (each with different distributions)
6. I ran my learning frameworks on the target dataset and generated a boxplot summarizing error values for anticausal+causal and causal models 
# Results and Findings
## Experiment results
The following figures show the error values for the causal and the anticausal models.

Again, these experiments show that once we increase the eta_transfer, that's the exogenous error of the transfer model, the anticausal model have a very large error compared to the causal model. However, when the exogenous error is kept low, the anticausal model behaves better than the causal model.
